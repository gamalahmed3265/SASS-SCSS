SASS and SCSS are both preprocessors for CSS. They allow you to write more powerful and maintainable CSS code.

* **SASS** (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is the original syntax for Sass. It uses indentation to denote nesting, and newlines to separate statements.
* **SCSS** (Sassy CSS) is a superset of CSS that adds support for some of the features of SASS. It uses the same syntax as CSS, with the addition of colons to denote nesting, and semicolons to separate statements.

**Here are some of the benefits of using SASS or SCSS:**

* **You can write more maintainable code.** Sass and SCSS allow you to use variables, mixins, and functions to DRY up your code. This makes it easier to read and understand, and it also makes it easier to make changes later on.
* **You can write more powerful code.** Sass and SCSS allow you to do things with CSS that you couldn't do before, such as nesting rules, extending rules, and using variables. This gives you more control over your CSS, and it allows you to create more complex and sophisticated designs.
* **You can write more portable code.** Sass and SCSS can be compiled to CSS, which means that you can use it with any CSS-compatible browser. This makes your code more portable, and it also makes it easier to share your code with others.

**Which one should you use?**

Sass and SCSS are both great options, but there are some differences between them. SASS is the original syntax, and it's a bit more powerful than SCSS. However, SCSS is easier to learn, and it's more compatible with CSS.

If you're new to Sass, I recommend starting with SCSS. It's a good way to learn the basics of Sass, and it's also a good way to make your CSS code more maintainable and powerful.

Once you're comfortable with SCSS, you can try out SASS if you want to. SASS is a bit more powerful, but it's also a bit more complex.
